Using the SHA512 checksums supplied here, we have verified that all gems match
at least one third-party mirror or excluding gems that have been yanked.

Gems that have been yanked are not installable with rubygems or bundler.

Using rubygems_verify.rb 13689 gems were found with 2 or fewer checksums from
third-party mirrors or caches, again excluding gems that have been yanked.

These can be found in unverified.2_or_fewer_checksums.txt

All the gems with 2 or fewer checksums are pre-release versions according to:

  ruby -ne 'gets =~ /-(.*?)\.gem/; puts $_ unless $1 =~ /\w/' \
    unverified.2_or_fewer_checksums.txt

This finds the gem version and checks it for any alphabet character.  If it
contains any alphabet character it is a pre-release.
